# Why use this?

Normally we run after using library for even a small change, in case of any sort of datetime, processing or formatting we hustle to use moment normally without even thinking if we can do it ourself, So just to keep it light, i have shown here some example in which using only Javascript datetime we can have different outputs.

`UTC String Date: Thu, 23 Dec 2021 00:00:00 GMT`
`ISO String Date: 2021-12-23T00:00:00.000Z`
`Local String Date: 23/12/2021`
`Get Time Zone: +05:00`
`Check if date is in past: Yes`
`Check days duration: -2`
`Get Time Zone Region: Asia/Karachi`
`Get formatted Date: 11/DEC/2021`
`Get formatted Date: 02:14`
`Get formatted Date: Sun Dec 12 2021 05:00`
